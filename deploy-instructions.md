# GitHub Pages Deployment - Alternative Methods

## Method 1: GitHub Actions (Recommended)

### Step 1: Upload the workflow file
1. Make sure you have the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file in your repository
2. If not, create the folder structure and upload this file:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pages: write
      id-token: write
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
    - name: Setup Pages
      uses: actions/configure-pages@v4
      
    - name: Upload artifact
      uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
      with:
        path: '.'
        
    - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      id: deployment
      uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages with Actions
1. Go to your repository Settings
2. Click "Pages" in the left sidebar
3. Under "Source", select **"GitHub Actions"** (not "Deploy from branch")
4. This should work without needing to save manually

## Method 2: Force Branch Method

### If the save button doesn't work:
1. Try refreshing the page and trying again
2. Try using a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
3. Clear your browser cache and cookies for GitHub
4. Try on mobile browser or incognito mode

## Method 3: Alternative Hosting (Quick Fix)

2. Sign up with GitHub account
3. Click "Add new site" â†’ "Import an existing project"
4. Connect to GitHub and select your quote-io repository
5. Deploy settings: 
   - Build command: (leave empty)
   - Publish directory: (leave empty or put "/")
6. Click "Deploy site"
7. You'll get a URL like: `https://amazing-name-123456.netlify.app`

### Vercel (Also Free):
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click "New Project"

## Method 4: Manual File Upload

2. Create a new repository named exactly: `yourusername.github.io`
3. Upload all files to this special repository
4. Your site will be live at: `https://yourusername.github.io`

## Checking Your Current Repository Status

Visit your repository and check:
- âœ… Repository is PUBLIC
- âœ… Has index.html in root
- âœ… Has main branch
- âœ… All files are uploaded

## Quick Test URLs

After deployment, test these URLs:
- `https://shakti826.github.io/quote-io/` (with trailing slash)
- `https://shakti826.github.io/quote-io/index.html` (direct file)
